# Cpp-CustomList
This project was created to practice creating own list in C++. I created two lists: cylic and non-cyclic. Both lists are one-way. Containers provides all methods according to the std::list.
<br/>Applied smart pointers (but it could be replaced by simple c++ pointers for performance).
